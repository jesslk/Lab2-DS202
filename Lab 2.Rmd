## Lab 2
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
```

1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?

```{r}
nrow(choco)
```

2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports. 


```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Review.Date, fill = Review.Date)) + geom_bar()
```

This is a right-skewed distribution, so we can conclude that the number of ratings are more concentrated in 2014 ~ 2016.
